#
# What it checks, and what it deliberately does not:
#
#   1. Every src/*.c compiles with -DNON_MATCHING, through the pinned pipeline,
#      into build/nonmatching/ (Makefile target `nonmatching`).
#   2. Every symbol a NON_MATCHING object leaves undefined is defined somewhere
#      in the REAL link (build/pepsiman.elf). A body that calls a function under a
#      name that no longer exists compiles fine and could never link; this is
#      the round-33/35 never-linked-body class, caught here mechanically.
#
# It does NOT link, verify or score anything. build/nonmatching/ is not the
# oracle. A NON_MATCHING body is readable documentation of a function the
# verified build still carries as INCLUDE_ASM, and this script only proves the
# documentation is real C. See docs/FINISHING-PLAN.md, track 1b.
#
# Run the real oracle FIRST: the undefined-symbol check reads build/pepsiman.elf,
# so a stale or missing verified build makes step 2 lie in both directions.
