"""Rename a symbol everywhere it lives, then re-extract and re-verify.

    python3 tools/rename.py OLD NEW              # do it
    python3 tools/rename.py OLD NEW --dry-run    # show what would change
    python3 tools/rename.py OLD NEW --no-build   # edit only (batching renames)

WHY THIS EXISTS. A symbol name lives in five places that nothing keeps in
step: the splat symbols file (which decides what `make extract` writes into
asm/), the C in src/ and include/, the match report whose FILENAME is the
function's name (tools/progress.py keys STALL vs FRESH on that file existing),
and every other report or doc that mentions it. Renaming by hand gets one of
them wrong, and the wrong one is usually the report filename, which silently
turns a documented stall back into fresh ground. Readability work (FINISHING-
PLAN.md, track 3) is hundreds of renames, so this has to be one command.

WHAT IT DOES, in order:
  1. resolves OLD's address: from the name if it is a splat placeholder
     (`func_800XXXXX`, `D_800XXXXX`), else from the symbols file;
  2. refuses if NEW is not a C identifier, is already a symbol or visible where
     OLD is used (an unrelated local elsewhere is only noted), or is a
     splat placeholder spelling other than OLD's own (renaming to OLD's own
     placeholder UNNAMES it); refuses a game-style `gName`/`sName` for data
     every accessor of which is Sony library code (tools/sonydata.py);
  3. rewrites the symbols file (replaces OLD's line, or appends a line for a
     placeholder that had none) and every whole-word OLD in src/, include/,
     the report files and the live docs -- NOT docs/PROGRESS.md and NOT
     docs/archive/, which are narrative frozen at the time of writing, and NOT
     the rule docs (RULE_DOCS), whose mentions are listed instead;
  4. renames docs/match-reports/OLD.md to NEW.md and prepends a note so the
     old name stays greppable;
  5. `make extract` (asm/ is generated from the symbols file), then
     `./build-and-verify.sh`, then `python3 tools/gpsyms.py --check` for a
     data symbol. A rename changes ZERO bytes, so a red build means the rename
     is wrong; the tool prints the revert commands and exits 1.

WHAT IT DOES NOT DO. It does not judge the name. The naming rules (what the
code does, not what you guess it is for; tiers; conventions) are in
FINISHING-PLAN.md track 3, and the evidence for a name goes in the match
report. It does not touch config/psyq-objects.ld or the splat yaml: Sony's
object symbols are Sony's names and are not renamed; yaml comments are
provenance.
