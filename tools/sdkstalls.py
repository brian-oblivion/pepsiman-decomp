"""Cross the live INCLUDE_ASM stall queue against Sony objects already placed
inside GAME segments.

Why this exists
---------------
`psyq_sdk.py coverage` has always printed a section headed "Placed objects that
fall inside GAME-code segments (SDK code miscounted as game)". It is telling
the truth and nobody crossed it against the STALL QUEUE, so functions Sony
owns kept attracting decompilation attempts as if they were game code.

That is expensive in the direction the project cares about. A function inside a
placed object cannot be matched by writing C -- the bytes come from Sony's
object, not from anything cc1 will produce from a game source file -- so every
attempt is spent for certain. Round 20 lost a sitting to `func_8003FC70`
(libgs/gs_108.o) this way; round 32 found fourteen more, carrying several
thousand lines of accumulated derivation between them.

CLAUDE.md already states the rule ("Never write C for a function a Sony object
owns") and already names the command to check it. The gap was never the rule,
it was that checking meant reading a 60-line object list against a 200-line
queue by hand, per round, and noticing an overlap in hex. This does that.

Usage
-----
    python3 tools/sdkstalls.py            # the overlaps, worst first
    python3 tools/sdkstalls.py --all      # plus every placed object in a game segment

A FULLY-contained hit is conclusive: convert it per docs/SDK-OBJECTS-GUIDE.md
rather than decompiling it. A PARTIAL hit means the function straddles an
object boundary, which usually means a mis-carve or a mis-placed object -- read
it before acting, and do not assume either half.
