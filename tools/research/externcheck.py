"""Find `extern` function declarations whose ARITY disagrees with the
function's definition or with another declaration of the same name.

    python3 tools/research/externcheck.py            # whole tree; exit 1 on any conflict
    python3 tools/research/externcheck.py <func>...  # just these names

WHY THIS EXISTS (round 57). `class_3bb8c_p.c` declared
`extern s32 func_8001E7BC(void)` and called it with no arguments, while the
function's real signature, established when it was matched that round, takes
three. The call site was byte-identical either way, because the values the
callee reads were already sitting in $a0..$a2. The byte oracle CANNOT see a
wrong prototype, and a wrong one survives for as long as the callee stays
INCLUDE_ASM, since no definition exists to conflict with. The compiler only
catches it once both a definition and the wrong extern land in one
translation unit, which the project's local-extern convention makes rare.

What this reads: every `extern <type> NAME(<params>);` in src/ and include/,
and every function DEFINITION in src/ (live code: `#if 0` and NON_MATCHING
blocks stripped, like progress.py). It compares PARAMETER COUNTS only, which
is what the register-forwarding trap changes; types are left to the compiler.
`(void)` and `()` both count as zero. A variadic `...` is skipped.

Run it after any round that MATCHES a function (PARALLEL-RUNS 3.9), because
a match is the moment a real signature first exists to check externs against.
