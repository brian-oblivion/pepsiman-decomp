#   tools/teardown-worktree.sh <name>
#
# `git worktree remove --force` is the only form that works here (asm/,
# build/ and pepsiman.ld are untracked, so plain remove always refuses), and
# --force disables git's own "are you sure". PARALLEL-RUNS 3.9 lists four
# preconditions to check by hand before it; round 57's head chained the
# command onto a push and removed a worktree while main..runner/bravo still
# held an unmerged commit. Nothing was lost that time. This script is the
# guard that fails instead of relying on the head to look:
#
#   1. the branch has NO commits that main lacks (everything merged);
#   2. the worktree has no uncommitted changes;
#   3. no permuter process, or multiprocessing worker of one, is cwd-ed into the worktree.
#
# The fourth precondition (every touched function has a report) is checked by
# the merge, not here. Pass --i-know for a deliberate discard of a branch you
# have decided to drop; it prints what is being dropped first.
