    the last build that succeeded -- and when that build had the function as
    INCLUDE_ASM, the comparison is retail against retail and the score reads as
    a FULL MATCH with no diagnostic anywhere.

    enough: a stale number can be PLAUSIBLE AND SELF-CONSISTENT. It will often
    equal a real score you measured minutes earlier, so nothing about the
    number itself looks wrong.

    Comparing mtimes is a heuristic in one direction only -- it cannot catch a
    stale build whose sources were not touched -- but it never fires falsely,
    and it catches the sequence that actually recurs: edit, build fails, read
