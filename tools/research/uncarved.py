"""Gate 2: census the UNCARVED monoliths, screened per function.

WHY THIS EXISTS.  Gate 2 in docs/PARALLEL-RUNS.md tells the head to carve when
the fresh queue is thin, and to pick the slice by BLOCKER DENSITY rather than
by "next".  Every head has rebuilt that census by hand, and the doc records
three separate written-down censuses going stale by being acted on -- which is
why it now says "do not work from a written list" three times and gives the
`grep -c '^glabel'` one-liner instead.  But that one-liner counts FUNCTIONS,
not WORKABLE functions, and those are wildly different numbers: `class_3bb8c_h`
counted 17 and held 4.

So this is the Gate 2 companion to tools/nearmiss.py, built the same way and
for the same reason.  It answers the question Gate 2 actually asks -- "is there
still ground out there worth carving, and where?" -- as a measurement instead
of a paragraph.

It runs the SAME FOUR SCREENS as nearmiss.py, and it shells out to the
canonical grep forms from the doc rather than re-expressing them.  That matters
most for `nop_mflo_mfhi`: the window runs FORWARD (an mflo/mfhi FOLLOWED WITHIN
TWO INSTRUCTIONS BY a mult/div), `grep -A2` prints the two FOLLOWING lines, and
every re-implementation so far has inverted it (rounds 15, 16) or added a false
qualifier (round 24).  Do not rewrite the window; call the grep.

`addiu_at` is NOT a blocker -- resolved round 21, maspsx `--addiu-at`.  It is
reported, tagged, and NOT counted, exactly as nearmiss.py does it, because
older notes still blame it and the tag is how you tell "this note's verdict
predates the fix" from "this is really blocked".

BIOS trampolines are the fourth screen and they are why raw glabel counts
mislead.  A trampoline (`addiu $t2,$zero,0xB0 / jr $t2 / addiu $t1,$zero,N`)
has no gp_rel, no addiu $at and no mflo/mfhi, so all the other screens PASS it
while no C compiles to it.  A trampoline-dense segment therefore reads as the
cleanest ground in the executable while being the least matchable.

Usage:
    python3 tools/research/uncarved.py              # per-segment summary, best first
    python3 tools/research/uncarved.py --functions  # every function, with its screens
    python3 tools/research/uncarved.py --windows 20 # rolling clean-density windows
