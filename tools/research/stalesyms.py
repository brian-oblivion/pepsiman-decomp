"""Find match reports whose PRESERVED BODY references a symbol since RENAMED.

WHY THIS EXISTS (round 35). A preserved near-miss body in a match report is
source you are meant to splice back in and rebuild -- CLAUDE.md requires it be
inlined "with every declaration it needs, positioned where it would compile".
It stops being that the moment a symbol it calls is renamed underneath it,
which is exactly what an SDK-object round does, wholesale, when it identifies a
placeholder `func_XXXXXXXX` as a real Sony symbol (`func_80025900` -> `VSync`).

The body still LOOKS right. It is internally consistent, it reads correctly,
and nothing static exposes the problem: it simply would not LINK. Round 33
found the first instance by hand (`func_800375E8`, really `SpuSetNoiseVoice`).
Round 35 found two more INDEPENDENTLY and in the same sitting -- echo hit four
renames in one unit, and delta found `func_8004109C`'s recorded 42/56 had never
been measured at all (funcdiff's staleness guard fired). Three instances across
three rounds is a class, not a coincidence, and the corpus census below is why
it needed a tool rather than another warning.

The check is mechanical because a placeholder name ENCODES its own address:
`func_80025900` claims 0x80025900. If the symbol table now gives that address a
different name, a body still calling `func_80025900` cannot link.

TWO THINGS THIS TOOL DOES NOT CLAIM, both measured rather than assumed:

- **A stale name does not invalidate the recorded RESIDUE.** Echo rebuilt all
  three of its bodies with corrected names and reproduced the recorded scores
  exactly. What is unverified is whether anyone ever BUILT the body -- which is
  the whole point of Gate 1b's "build the inherited body once" rule. Treat a
  hit as "this figure is unverified until someone compiles it", not as "this
  figure is wrong".
- **A hit does not mean nobody noticed.** Some flagged reports already document
  the rename in prose and still leave the BODY on the old names -- the runner
  corrected the names in its working tree to measure, and the durable artifact
  kept the un-linkable version. Those are the cheapest to fix and the easiest
  to miss, because the report reads as though it were already handled.
- **A hit on an ALREADY-MATCHED function is archival, not actionable**, and
  round 36 measured the split: of the flagged reports, **120 belong to
  functions already matched** and only **33 are still `INCLUDE_ASM`**. For a
  matched function `src/` is the source of truth and the report's code fence is
  a historical record -- its stale name gates nothing and rebuilding it buys
  nothing. For a live one the body IS the next runner's starting point and its
  recorded figure is unverified until someone compiles it. Round 35's headline
  ("most recorded near-miss figures in this corpus are attached to bodies that
  will not link") was right about the mechanism and four times too large about
  the queue, because the tool did not know which half it was looking at. It
  does now: read the LIVE section, and treat ARCHIVAL as cleanup.
- **THE TOOL USED TO FLAG ITS OWN REPAIRS, and that is the failure mode that
  matters most here.** Round 36 shipped three corrected bodies and the tool
  re-flagged all three the same afternoon, by three routes: a prose sentence
  writing "`#if 0`" in backticks opened a bogus region running to the next
  real `#endif`; a corrected body's own `/* ... (was func_XXXXXXXX) ... */`
  note, which the project REQUIRES it to carry, was scanned as code; and a
  round-18 "here is what I tried" ```c fence was read as a resume-from body.
  All three are fixed above (line-anchored `#if 0`, comments stripped, `#if 0`
  authoritative when present). The general shape is worth keeping in view: a
  screen whose hit SURVIVES the fix never converges, the count never falls,
  and the next round re-staffs work already done -- the same expensive
  direction as a false blocker, arriving through documentation rather than
  through a grep.

Scanning whole reports instead of just the preserved regions over-reports by
roughly an order of magnitude: a prose mention of an old name is harmless and
usually historically accurate. Only `#if 0 ... #endif` blocks and ```c fences
are scanned, which is where linkage actually matters.

Usage:  python3 tools/research/stalesyms.py [--reports DIR] [--quiet] [--all] [--fix]
        --all also lists the ARCHIVAL (already-matched) reports in full.
        --fix rewrites the stale names inside the `#if 0` blocks of the
        OUTSTANDING live reports (not the head-annotated ones, not the
        fence-only ones) and leaves a dated note under each repaired `#if 0`.
        The residue those bodies recorded stays UNVERIFIED until rebuilt;
        the fix only makes them link as written (revision 10, round 65).
Exit 1 if any stale reference is found, so it can gate a round.
