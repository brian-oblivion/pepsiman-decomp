"""Game code inside `psyq_*` segments: the inverse of config/sdk-in-game.txt.

    .venv/bin/python3 tools/gameinsdk.py            # every psyq_* function, classified, as runs
    .venv/bin/python3 tools/gameinsdk.py --write    # regenerate config/game-in-sdk.txt
    .venv/bin/python3 tools/gameinsdk.py --check    # exit 1 if it is stale

WHY THIS EXISTS (FINISHING-PLAN revision 18). `progress.py` counts a
`psyq_*` segment as library BY NAME, and the names were given by position:
a gap between two placed Sony objects was called "the game's own libspu
build, which no disc has". Measured 2026-09-25, ten of those segments held
game code instead -- methods listed in BasicClass-derived method tables and
functions that `jal` the game's framework -- and progress.py reported "100%
of game code matched" with over two hundred game functions never carved.
Revision 13 fixed the mirror image (Sony code in game-named segments, now
config/sdk-in-game.txt); this is the other direction.

EVIDENCE. A psyq_* function is GAME when any of these holds, iterated to a
fixed point:

  call    it `jal`s or `j`s a function that is game code. Sony's libraries
          never call the game by name; a linked Sony object that calls game
          code does it through a psyq-objects.ld pin, and those targets are
          library (progress.is_library), so they are not evidence.
  table   it sits in a run of function pointers in data (a method table)
          together with a game function.
  bracket it lies in a run of unclassified functions whose neighbours on
          both sides, inside the same segment, are game. An object file is
          contiguous in the link.
  edge    it lies in such a run that touches game code on ONE side, and
          every referrer of the run (caller or `lui`/`addiu` address-taker)
          from outside it is game, with at least one. The adjacency is what
          makes this sound: "all its callers are game" alone describes every
          Sony API the game calls (DrawSync, ClearImage), so it is never used
          on its own.

GUARD. Whatever the evidence, a function stays SONY when it carries a Sony
name the SDK corpus knows, a psyq-objects.ld pin, an EXACT relocation-masked
fingerprint of at least sdkname.GAME_MIN_WORDS words whose candidates agree on
one name or one module, or a shape lead (>= sdkname.LEAD_SHAPE at >=
sdkname.LEAD_MIN_WORDS words). Game evidence on a guarded function is printed
as a CONFLICT and needs a person. Tiny exact matches (a 4-word `jr $ra`
stub matches dozens of Sony stubs) guard nothing, as in sdkname.py --game.

THE FILE. config/game-in-sdk.txt lists every GAME function still inside a
psyq_* segment. progress.py counts them as game (so they show as uncarved
ground, and uncarved.py lists them), which is the honest state until they are
carved into C units (PARALLEL-RUNS Gate 2). After a complete carve it lists
none, and `--check` keeps it that way: a new psyq_* segment that holds game
code makes it stale.
