"""Cut a linked PS-X EXE to the length its own header gives.

`objcopy -O binary` writes every loaded byte, and GCC 2.6.3 emits an
initialized `.sbss` as data, so the image runs on to the end of the last
`.sbss` object. Retail's file stops at 0x800 + its header's text size
(a 2 KB sector boundary): its `.sbss` was never in the file, and
the zeros up to that boundary are sector padding.

Only zeros may be cut. A non-zero byte past the end means real data was
placed there, and the build stops rather than hide it.

Usage: exe_trim.py <exe>
