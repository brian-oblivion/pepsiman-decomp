# Matching learnings for GCC 2.8.1

Source shapes that reproduce Pepsiman's code, each proved by a byte-exact
match. They are specific to the pinned compiler (GCC 2.8.1, -G8, aspsx 2.56);
`docs/lsd-reference/DECOMPILATION_LEARNINGS.md` was learned on 2.6.3 and is
only a list of things to try. One idiom per entry: what retail shows, what
the source was, and the function that proved it. The story belongs in that
function's match report, not here.

## Declarations

- **How a global is reached says how it was declared** (CLAUDE.md, "Facts
  worth knowing"). Confirmed across round 1: `%gp_rel` and `lui $at` are a
  plain extern; `lui <reg>` + `%lo(sym)(<reg>)` is an array of unknown size,
  including a `.sdata` string reached `lui`/`addiu` (`extern char
  D_800954CC[];`, func_80014BF0) and a halfword table head stored through
  `lui $v0` (`extern u16 D_80095B4C[];`, func_800338D8).
- **Sony's prototypes come from Sony's headers.** They include cleanly after
  `common.h`; `libgpu.h` needs `libgte.h` first (SVECTOR, MATRIX). A local
  prototype of a Sony function fails declcheck as soon as a header declares
  it. (func_80014D20, func_80014D6C)

## Types

- **`sll r, r, 24` + `bnez` testing a byte: an `s8`.** A `u8` gives
  `andi 0xFF`. (func_800173E8)
- **A byte store of `addiu $x, $zero, -1`: the value is `s8` -1.** A `u8` 0xFF
  gives `addiu ..., 0xFF`. (func_80033854)

## Loops

- **A loop counting up from 0 and tested with `sltiu`: a `u32` counter.** With
  `s32`, 2.8.1 reverses the loop into a count-down `bgez`. (func_80033854)
- **A pointer bumped before the loop's constants: the source advanced the
  parameter** as its own statement (`recs += 100;`). Indexing `recs[i]` from
  100 strength-reduces to the same loop with the `addiu` after the constants.
  (func_80033878)
- **A loop pointer biased to a field other than the first one written (stores
  at negative offsets): the source walked a separate struct pointer**, `r =
  &tbl[k]; ... r->f = ...; r++;`. Every `tbl[i].f` form reduces to the record
  start. (func_800338D8)
- **A compare loop that loads both bytes before either increment: the
  increments are separate statements after the test**, `if (*a != *b) return
  -1; a++; b++;`. In `*a++ != *b++`, 2.8.1 schedules `b++` before the load of
  `*a`. (func_8003828C)

## Control flow and frames

- **A compare retail keeps that the `&&` chain would fold: a `switch` with an
  empty `case K: break;`.** (func_800173E8)
- **A leaf with `addiu $sp, -8` / `+8` and no stack access: an unused local**,
  `s32 unused[2];`. Without it 2.8.1 emits no frame. Triggers `-Wall`'s unused
  variable warning, which is baselined in `config/typeviews-warnings.txt`.
  (func_80014CF0)
- **A `nop` in a loop's back-branch delay slot where the build fills it from
  the loop target with an instruction writing `$v0`: the function is non-void
  with no `return`** (likely K&R implicit int). The live return register
  blocks the fill. Triggers "control reaches end of non-void function",
  baselined likewise. (func_8002D140; func_8002D16C and func_8002D1CC show the
  same slot)

## Scheduling

- **A field loaded after earlier global stores: read it through a byte
  pointer**, `*(s32 *)((u8 *)p + 4)`. A member access (`p->offset`, and also
  `((s32 *)p)[1]`) lets the load rise above the stores. Once the load is in
  place, the order of the global stores decides the rest. Why the second form
  rises is not understood; treat the alias explanation as a hypothesis.
