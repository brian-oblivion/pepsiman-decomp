"""Project progress: functions matched / queued / stalled / uncarved.

    python3 tools/progress.py
    python3 tools/progress.py --json

COLUMNS, and the distinctions matter because runner assignment is made from
them (docs/PARALLEL-RUNS.md, Gate 1):

  matched   defined as real C in a src/ unit. The build is byte-verified, so
            "defined in C" == "matched" for as long as build-and-verify.sh is
            green -- which is the only reason this can be counted statically.
  queued    INCLUDE_ASM entries: carved into a C unit, awaiting decompilation.
  stalled   queued AND has a docs/match-reports/ file (archive/process),
            or keeps its readable body under `#ifdef NON_MATCHING`: someone
            already attempted it and it did not go. NOT fresh ground.
  banked    queued, unattempted, in a unit whose header says DELIBERATELY
            UNWORKED -- carved to fix a boundary or bank the ground, but
            classified as senior work rather than cold-runner work.
  reopened  queued AND has a report, but that report carries one of the two
            EXACT line-anchored markers below. Counted as FRESH, not as a
            stall. Both exist for the same reason: this tool decides stall-vs-
            fresh purely by whether a report FILE exists, so any report that is
            not a stall verdict silently deletes matchable ground from every
            future round.

              REOPENED -- ASSIGNABLE
                  The report's stall verdict has been INVALIDATED, almost
                  always because the blocker it blamed was resolved. A report
                  written while a blocker was live outlives the blocker, and a
                  function everybody believes is blocked is one nobody
                  re-measures. `addiu_at` resolving in round 21 left five such
                  reports.

              DERIVATION ONLY -- ASSIGNABLE
                  No C was ever written or compiled: the report is a partial
                  derivation of a body too large to attempt in one bounded
                  session, which the project asks for rather than a heroic
                  single attempt. There is no stall verdict to invalidate,
                  because there was never an attempt. Added round 25, when
                  runner bravo filed exactly this for func_80032D34 (274w) and
                  wrote in its own prose "deliberately NOT filed as a STALL"
                  -- prose this tool cannot read, so the function left `fresh`
                  anyway. Do NOT use it for a body that WAS built and scored;
                  that is a real stall however low the score.

            Both are the counterpart of DELIBERATELY UNWORKED: an exact phrase,
            keyed on by this tool, that lets a report stay on disk (its
            derivation is still worth reading) without still claiming the
            function is worked.
  fresh     queued - stalled - banked. THE ONLY COLUMN TO ASSIGN FROM. Raw
            `queued` includes documented stalls, and staffing a runner onto
            one means paying again to re-derive what someone already recorded.
  uncarved  still inside a monolithic `asm` segment; needs a carve first.
  library   Sony Psy-Q SDK code compiled into the executable. Excluded from the
            game-code denominator -- it is not this game's source and matching
            it proves nothing about the game.

Byte metrics need a linked build/pepsiman.elf, so run ./build-and-verify.sh
first. Sizes weight a 400-instruction dispatcher above a 6-word leaf, which is
the honest way to read "how much is left".

    the live INCLUDE_ASM in its `#else`. NEITHER form is compiled by the

    strip catches a commented-out INCLUDE_ASM, which would otherwise be counted
    as a queued function that does not exist.

    This is a small preprocessor walk rather than three regexes (round 64):

    one, and could not see that the INCLUDE_ASM in the `#else` of an

    genuine match, inverting its signal exactly when a function closes. Only
    `#if 0`, `#if 1`, `#ifdef/#ifndef NON_MATCHING` and their `#else`/`#elif`
    are decided; any other conditional keeps both arms. Directive lines
    themselves are dropped.
