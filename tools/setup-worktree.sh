# Creates ../<checkout>-wt-<name> on branch runner/<name> -- <checkout> is the
# basename of the MAIN checkout, derived at run time, not a fixed string (the
# script's own output prints the real path; trust that, not this comment).
# Symlinks the
# gitignored essentials from the main checkout (the executable, the venv, the
# toolchain), extracts asm/, and PROVES the worktree byte-verifies before
# handing it over.
#
# WHY A WORKTREE AND NOT JUST ANOTHER CLONE OR ANOTHER SHELL. Two sessions in
# one checkout share `build/`. Concurrent `build-and-verify.sh` runs interleave
# objects and can report a FALSE MISMATCH -- which poisons the only oracle this
# project has, and does it silently. A worktree gives each session its own
# working tree, its own build directory and its own branch, while sharing
# history so the head can merge normally.

Start a runner session there with the prompt in docs/lsd-reference/PARALLEL-RUNS.md.

Tear down only after the four preconditions in PARALLEL-RUNS.md section 3.9, and
only through the guard, which refuses on unmerged commits, a dirty tree or a
live permuter (plain \`git worktree remove --force\` skips all three):
