"""Game-style names on data only Sony code reads, and Sony's name for each.

    python3 tools/sonydata.py            # list them, with Sony's name where a disc gives one
    python3 tools/sonydata.py --check    # exit 1 if any 

WHY. FINISHING-PLAN's rule is that nothing Sony owns gets a game name.
rename.py enforces it for variables config/psyq-objects.ld pins, which covers
only objects that PLACED. An object that never placed (libsnd/vmanager.o: its
functions were matched one at a time as C) has no pins, so its bss took game
names: round 86 found gVoiceEnv*/gVoiceFade* (fields of `_svm_voice`),
gVoiceActivityRing/Idx (`_svm_envx_hist`/`_ptr`) and more.

WHAT. A data symbol in the symbols file whose name follows the game convention
(`gName`/`sName`) and whose every accessor, read from the relocations in the
BUILT objects, is a function progress.py counts as library. A symbol with no
accessor found (no build, or referenced only by linked Sony objects) is not
listed: unknown is not Sony's.

SONY'S NAME. Each accessor is aligned, opcode by opcode, against the function
of the same name in every SDK object (sdk/work/*/elf); where our instruction
relocates against the flagged symbol, the aligned Sony instruction's
relocation names Sony's symbol (+addend when inside a table). A `.bss`/`.data`
target that stays UNRESOLVED means the variable is STATIC in Sony's object: no
disc carries its name, so the honest spelling is the placeholder, with an
`identified` comment saying whose it is. A section target is first resolved by its addend
against the object's own symbols, because these converted objects reach even
their named weak bss section-relative. Candidates are printed per disc.

EVERY ANSWER IS A LEAD. The ratio compares mnemonics and ignores addresses,
so a build can align 1.00 and still lay its data out differently (round 86:
3.3's SsSetTickMode aligns 1.00 and puts `_snd_seq_tick_mode` beside
`_snd_openflag`, 0x8008EA04, while retail reads 0x8006DCA4). A name becomes a
verdict when the object's layout lands the address: an anchor symbol already
pinned or identified in the same object at the right distance (vmanager.o's
bss from `_svm_sreg_buf`), or the object's initialised bytes found at the
address in retail (libapi/counter.o's .data at 0x8006DCAC), or the object's
variables found in retail in their declaration order (ssinit.o's at
0x8006DC8C..A8). Weak bss Sony's linker scattered (vm_g.o) has no layout to
land; there the verdict is every aligned access on every disc naming the same
symbol (`_svm_auto_kof_mode`, discs 3.0 to 3.6). Record the anchor in the
symbols file's `identified` comment.
