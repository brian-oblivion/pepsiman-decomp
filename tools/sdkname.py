"""Identify an unnamed Psy-Q function in retail by fingerprinting it against
every function in every SDK object on every disc in sdk/.

    .venv/bin/python3 tools/sdkname.py func_8003B20C [func_...]   # rank candidates
    .venv/bin/python3 tools/sdkname.py --all                       # every game-called unnamed SDK function
    .venv/bin/python3 tools/sdkname.py --selfcheck 10              # prove the tool on placed functions
    .venv/bin/python3 tools/sdkname.py --game [--write|--check]    # Sony code inside GAME segments

WHY THIS EXISTS (FINISHING-PLAN.md, track 2). `tools/psyq_sdk.py match` places
a whole OBJECT only when its relocation-masked .text is byte-identical to
retail. The game linked some libraries from a build none of the four discs
carries (libgpu/libcd, December 1995), so those objects never place, and the
functions inside them stay `func_XXXXXXXX` even though a later build of the
same function is sitting on a disc, ninety percent identical. Game code calls
46 of them, and the goal is the NAME, not a byte match.

HOW IT SCORES. For each function symbol in each converted object
(sdk/work/<ver>/elf/**/*.o), the object's words with every relocated field
masked out (R_MIPS_26: low 26 bits; HI16/LO16/GPREL16/16: low 16 bits;
R_MIPS_32: the whole word), against the retail words with the SAME fields
masked. Two figures per candidate:

  exact   same length AND every masked word equal: the strongest evidence,
          this is the very build (the object just did not place as a whole,
          usually because a sibling function in it differs).
  masked  fraction of masked words equal at the same position, same length only.
  shape   SequenceMatcher ratio over opcode-and-register skeletons (the word
          with every immediate field zeroed), any length. This is what finds a
          function from a different build: immediates and offsets move,
          instruction order mostly does not.

A candidate is printed with the disc(s) and module it came from, so the
evidence rule in the plan (fingerprint plus one independent kind, or a
fingerprint above the self-check threshold) can be applied and recorded in the
symbols-file comment.

--selfcheck takes N functions that ARE placed (config/psyq-objects.txt), hides
their names, and asks whether the top candidate is the right one. Run it
before believing the tool on an unplaced function; the printed threshold is
the lowest winning score among the checked functions.
