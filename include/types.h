/**
 * @file types.h
 * @brief Integer, float and truth-value types for the R3000 target.
 *
 * On this target `int` and `long` are 32 bits, `long long` is 64, and
 * plain `char` is unsigned (the build passes -funsigned-char). A signed
 * byte is therefore always written `s8`, never `char`.
 *
 * The same types go by three names here: the short names the game code
 * uses (`u8` .. `s64`), the C99 names (`uint8_t` .. `int64_t`), and Sony's
 * `u_char` .. `u_long` from <sys/types.h>.
 *
 * The host build (HOST_BUILD) takes the C99 and Sony names from psyz,
 * where `u_long` is as wide as a pointer, and defines only the short names
 * and bool here.
